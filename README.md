An array is a variable that can store multiple values.
It starts with an index 0 and has contiguous memory.
To create an array, define the data type and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [].
To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:
int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
