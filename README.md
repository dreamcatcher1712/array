# array
An array is a variable that can store multiple values.
Arrays have 0 as the first index.
To create an array, define the data type and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [].
To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:
      int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
